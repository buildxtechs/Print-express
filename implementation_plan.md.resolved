# PrintExpress Technical Stack & Hosting Plan

This document outlines the current technical architecture of the PrintExpress application and provides a strategic plan for hosting it on Hostinger.

## Technical Stack Summary

### Frontend (Client)
- **Framework**: React 19 (Modern, component-based UI)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (Fast development and optimized builds)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 (Utility-first CSS framework)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM (Single Page Application routing)
- **API Client**: Axios (Promise-based HTTP requests)
- **Utilities**: 
  - `pdf-lib`: For PDF document generation and modification.
  - `react-hot-toast`: For smooth, non-intrusive notifications.

### Backend (Server)
- **Runtime**: Node.js (High-performance Javascript runtime)
- **Framework**: Express.js (Minimal and flexible web application framework)
- **Database ODM**: Mongoose (Elegant MongoDB object modeling)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) & Bcryptjs (Password hashing)
- **File Handling**: Multer (Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`)
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe (Secure payment processing)

### Infrastructure & Services
- **Database**: MongoDB (Atlas Cloud recommended)
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary (Image and file asset management)
- **Email/Notifications**: Configurable via environment variables.

## Hosting strategy: Hostinger

### Recommended Hosting Plan: **VPS Hosting**
Since PrintExpress is a Node.js-based application (MERN stack), it requires a server environment where you can run long-running processes (Node.js/Express). 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Standard Shared Hosting on Hostinger is primarily optimized for PHP and may not provide the necessary environment for a robust Node.js application. **VPS Hosting** gives you full control and is the best fit for this stack.

### Deployment Steps on Hostinger VPS

#### 1. Server Environment Setup
- Install **Node.js** (LTS version).
- Install **PM2** (Process Manager) to keep the backend running 24/7.
- Install **Nginx** to act as a reverse proxy and serve frontend assets.

#### 2. Frontend Build
- Run `npm run build` in the `client` directory to generate the optimized `dist` folder.
- Point Nginx to serve the `dist` folder for the root domain.

#### 3. Backend Deployment
- Copy the `server` folder to the VPS.
- Install dependencies with `npm install --production`.
- Use PM2 to start the server: `pm2 start server.js --name printexpress-api`.

#### 4. Environment Configuration
- Create a `.env` file on the VPS with your production credentials (MONGODB_URI, CLOUDINARY_URL, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, etc.).

#### 5. SSL & Security
- Use **Certbot (Let's Encrypt)** to set up free SSL certificates for HTTPS.
- Configure Nginx to route `/api` requests to the Node.js backend (port 4000).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Frontend Access**: Verify the site loads via the domain name.
- **API Connectivity**: Test basic login/signup and data fetching to ensure the backend is connected to MongoDB Atlas.
- **Image Uploads**: Upload a sample image to verify Cloudinary integration.
- **Payments**: Use Stripe Test Mode to verify checkout flows.
